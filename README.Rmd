`spenv` - add environmental data to spatial data

Docs: https://sckott.github.io/spenv/

## Package API

* `sp_mutate` - get env data for occ data input - not ready yet
* `sp_extract_gridded` - extract env gridded data
* `sp_extract_pt` - extract env point data
* `sp_query` - query for env data - not ready yet
* `find_locs` - find locations/stations/etc. based on occ data input - internal fxn used in `sp_mutate`

## Data sources

* High priority: There are a set of data sources for environmental data, some of which are high priority as determined by perhaps data quality, coverage, etc. 
    * temperature, chlorophyll, ...
* Available in R: Then there are a set of data sources that are already available in R. 
* We should identify the set of high priority data sources that are not yet available in R, and make them so.

## Use cases

I want data...

* for this bounding box for this temporal range and spatial resolution
* that is of a certain license, because:
    * I want only open data, e.g., CC0
    * I want data I can redistribute
    * I want data that I can purchase or resell

## Install

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("sckott/spenv")
```

```{r}
library("spenv")
```

## Example: pt env data

```{r eval=FALSE}
file <- system.file("examples", "obis_mola_mola.csv", package = "spenv")
dat <- read.csv(file)
head(dat)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
res <- sp_extract_pt(x = dat[1:10,], radius = 100)
res[[1]]
```

## Example: gridded env data

```{r}
library("spocc")
res <- occ(query = 'Mola mola', from = 'obis', limit = 200)
res_df <- occ2df(res)
out <- sp_extract_gridded(res_df)
head(out)
```
